Article 1: The Grand Duchy of [[Vorn]] will be elevated into a Kingdom. 
Article 2: The Kingdom of Vorn will be recognised as the highest princely and electoral crown in the empire. It will therefore be equal to the Marcher Kingdom of [[Astviel]] in rank.
Article 3: The Ruler of the Arch Duchy of [[Veshni]] will be elected King of Vorn.
Article 4: The Kingdom of Vorn shall become an electoral monarchy.
Article 5: The [[Vornari]] estates will support the election of the arch duke of [[Veshni]] as imperial regent.
Article 6: The Status Quo Antebellum will be upheld in terms of territories and reparations.

Article 8: The Imperial Regent will recognise the continuation of the Kingdom of [[Vorn]]'s Arch-stewardship. 
Article 9: The King of Vorn will sign the [[Guilder League Prohibition Act]] and uphold the [[Dragon Pact]]
with due diligence. 
Article 10: The new King of Vorn will govern with the [[Vornari]] estates in due diligence and do his utmost to govern the realm effectively in mutual understand with the Rose Council. An neglect of duty will trigger an immediate election to settle for a new king.
