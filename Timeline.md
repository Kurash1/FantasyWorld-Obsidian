# Pre Divine War
## 300 - 250 PDW
### Modern Goblin Evolution
The modern form of goblins begin to take shape during this time period.

### Dungeons begin to appear
Some time after the appearance of the modern goblins, dungeons appear in the world. These dungeons contain both treasures and threats for the goblins, and these dungeons also replicate a more primitive version of the goblins. Ones without souls, and less rationale.

## 250 - 200 PDW
### The Formation of the Heavens
Through the power of the Goblins Faith, the heavens begin to form. With this the black skies of the world are replaced by a pleasant blue, and the first pseudo-gods begin to be born. These pseudo-gods were unable to interact with the mortal world, and could only sustain themselves off the faith of the goblins, but they existed nonetheless.

### Formation of the first Great Mountain
The formations of the first great mountains began around this time. A bridge between the mortal world and the heavens, the great mountains allowed gods to directly interact with the mortal world, while also allowing mortals to become gods. In addition the Great Mountains channeled massive amounts of sovereign less divine power to their peaks where it would be shared amongst the gods of that great mountain.

## 200 - 150 PDW
### Humans are created
The gods of a certain great mountain decide to create their own race called the humans. Other gods follow suit and create their own races, but out of these early races only the humans are remembered.

### Age of Dragons
A certain tribe of goblins believe into existence the first of the dragon-gods. A snake with eight hundred heads. This god creates the species of dragons, which come to dominate a large portion of the world. Many of them ascend to become dragon-gods as well. At some point the original dragon-god is slain and that begins the end of the age of dragons as dragon society becomes disconnected.

### Kingdom of Vidsk

### Beginning of the Divine War
The great mountain at the center of the continent, emboldened by their victories against smaller mountains declares war upon all other heavens. More specifically the 2 remaining heavens. The Heaven of the Giants in the north of the continent, and the Heaven of the southern continent.

### Birth of the Orcish Peoples
**2045**: Alexander slew his father and the supreme god Vilthur and went into exile to the mortal world. **2048**: The orcish gods no longer bound by Vilthur's laws went down to the mortal world and created the orcs. The orcish gods led their new peoples on a conquest path through the Sword-Valley destroying every dwarven hold while also turning most of the human citizens into more orcs.

### Dwarven exodus from the Sword-Valley
**2055**: The dwarves gave up the fight against the Orcish gods and retreated into the Great Caves. Their human citizens were left behind in the Sword-Valley. Only the strongest of these humans survived, and became the Sword-Valley tribes. The Orcish gods returned to heaven.

## 22nd Century
### Fall of the Gnomish empire
**2106**: The neighboring Gnomish Empire collapsed due to various problems caused by the fall of the Dwarven Civilization. They had lost their main trading partner, had gained a new incredibly ferocious enemy on their borders, and with all the death that had happened in the Sword-Valley a large population of demons had also been born. This all coincided with a new great horde of Centaurs becoming active, and one of the largest host of giants attacking all at once.

### Rise of the Empire of Humanity
**2112**: Alexander seeing the devastation caused by the gods after his father's laws had been disrespected decided that there needs to be a new supreme god. And thus he set out to create one. He would make his brother, Orulkha into the supreme god of the humans, one of the most populous races. He reincarnated himself as a mortal human of one of the Sword-Valley tribes.

**2133**: Alexander called to arms all of the Sword-Valley tribes and founded a great army at the Veshner valley. By the end of 2133, he had conquered almost half of the Sword-Valley with most orcs swearing fealty to him upon just seeing him fight once. With his first steps into the heartlands he declared the human empire. With an army of 150,000 orcs and humans.

**2151**: Alexander and his children had conquered the ultimate extent of the empire. During this time many of them had taken governorship of large amounts of land, though the actual governance was heavily done by remaining gnomish bureacraucy that was kept around since the fall of the gnomish empire. There was a sligh era of peace after the final conquests where Alexander governed the empire. During this time the built some of the 'Kaer' projects, migrated the humans from the Sword-Valley to the other lands, but it all ended when Alexander saw his brother declared the Supreme God. He vanished into thin air, and his first child took the role of Imperial Regent in his absence. To this day the "Emperors" are acting as regents for Alexander.

**2152**: The Grand Duchy of Vorn calls for a meeting of the imperial princes to redistribute the power within the empire in the wake of Alexander's disappearance.The first imperial bull establishes the process of deciding on a new ruler on an electoral basis. The grand duchies of the empire carve up special offices among themselves to elevate their position further. Smaller princes were largely ignored.
