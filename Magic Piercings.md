Small and tiny enchanted piercings are often an overlooked form of magic item. Those items are however just as potent as their larger cousins and provide the wearer with various special benefits. In order to access the powers of such a piercing one must have an innate connection to magic and have worn the to be enchanted piercings for a considerable time before the enchantment process begins. Likewise enchanted piercings have to be crafted by the wielder themselves as they are deeply tied to the magic flowing through their body. An unenchanted piercing may be bought and set by anyone into your body beforehand but once the refinement into an enchanted item begins you have to do the deed yourself. The amount of time a piercing needs to adopt to your body and the magic within it is determined by the GM. It is wise to start out with such jewellery before the campaign starts in order to have a better shot at qualifying for the crafting process already. Furthermore enchanted piercings as presented here also provide heightened variants that are completed by further refinement by the wielder. In any case the GM decides the cost, materials and times for the crafting process. The proper tools for these processes are artisan tools.
