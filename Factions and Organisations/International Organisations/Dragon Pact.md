A mutual defence agreement between the following nations: [[Vorn]], [[Silkenglade]] , and [[Novenhaven]]. It was founded in the wake of the [[Guilder War]] to protect the core trade and foreign policy interests of [[Vorn]] and the elves. Efforts to include the Grand Duchy of [[Watar]] have so far failed though [[Vorn]] keeps trying. The reason for the lobbying of the watarians is that Vorn and the elves want to block the alternative land based trade route into the empire. Furthermore to build a safe guarded road to [[Novenhaven]] circumventing the [[Guilder League]] entirely. Thus making Port Rosen and even more important trade hub than it already is. If done so no land based trade will ever bypass the members of the Dragon Pact who all agreed to fairly share the income out of staple rights, taxes and tolls among themselves. If successful this would enable the Dragon Pact to not only dominate the land based trade from west to east but also make the port of [[Novenhaven]] one of the most important ports in the entire empire, financially bankrupting [[Hamburrow]] due to the [[Guilder League Prohibition Act]].
