Vornese is an ancient tongue that is written in the [[Draconic]] script. It is known to be highly semantically with words often having many meanings simultaneously. Still commonly spoken within [[Vorn]] the language never get any larger prominence than that. Though poets, writers and other artists often learn it to understand the rich nuances of vornese writings that other languages can barely grasp.  While vornese is written in the [[Draconic]] script it is nothing like the [[Draconic]] language. While [[Draconic]] is often a hard and intimidating language, vornese feels more like a gentle river of softness. A language that glides down like honey and has a melody like birdsong.
