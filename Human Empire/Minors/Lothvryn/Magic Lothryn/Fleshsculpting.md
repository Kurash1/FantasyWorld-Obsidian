Fleshsculpting is a procedure that remodels a subjects into a myriad of different forms. It is widely considered as subtype of fleshwarping. It differs in it so much that it attempts to achieve mainly aesthetically pleasing results to the client with practical concerns being largely regarded as secondary. Practitioners therefore view themselves rather as artists than anything else. The procedure is practised all over the world but is most prominently elevated in [[Lothvryn]], thanks to the esoteric magical occurrences the realm already experiences thus leading to many children being born altered, and in [[Astviel]] where ancient covens and other organisations practice this profession. Thus it can occur naturally but more conceptual ways to achieve this exist as well. Those include but are not limited to grafting, alchemical and magical procedures, as well as mundane surgical procedures. The limits of this form of reshaping are rather unknown and often tightly guarded by any fleshsculpter. But a few observations can be made some people who underwent the procedure now posses features reminiscent of serpentine, avian or even aquatic beings. A myriad of other forms however also  exist. The Elixir of Gender Transformation is also said by some scholars to be a form of fleshsculpting.
