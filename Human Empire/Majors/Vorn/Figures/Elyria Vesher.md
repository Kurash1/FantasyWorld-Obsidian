Elyria Vesher is the niece  of the imperial regent [[Lothaire Vesher]]. From a young age she was a studious girl and dreamt to one day enter the prominent [[University of Roseria]]. However such dreams were often ridiculed at the court of [[Veshni]]. This due to them rather partying than actually  governing or doing anything academic at all. Furthermore her [[Elf|elven]] mother and her own aiuvarin nature were also viewed with a good chunk of suspicion by the regent.  Over time she tried to compensate by working ever harder both in regards to governing and academically. However the nobility of [[Veshni]] absolutely disliked her meddling in what they viewed as their affairs. Ultimately this caused  the regent to kick her out of the country. Fuming with anger and vengeance in her eyes she went to the one place she knew would probably see her talents as actually worthwhile, [[Vorn]]. In [[Vorn]] she found more luck. The Rose Council agreed to depose the current king of Vorn [[Lothaire Vesher]] and elect her as queen instead. For he was seen as lazy and violating Article 11 of the [[Treaty of Roseria]]. This the Rose Council then took as grounds to declare his kingship void. The reaction from [[Veshni]] was as expected only a shrug, thus furthering the lingering anger the [[Guilder War]] caused in [[Vorn]]. Elyria in her election promised that she would deliver vengeance but she also emphasised that [[Vorn]] in its current state was ill equipped to handle any major conflict. Henceforth she proposed the following reforms known as the Elyrian Reforms. She is currently at her first day in office and only time will tell if she will succeed or be forgotten by history. The negotiations over this reforms are naturally not finished at this point in time either and the [[Vornari]] estates may pursue their own agendas after all.
