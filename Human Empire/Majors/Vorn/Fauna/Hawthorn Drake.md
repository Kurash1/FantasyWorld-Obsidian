A dangerous apex predator native to the southern forests of [[Vorn]] and the watarian forest. Hawthorn drakes are known to hunt in a rather peculiar way. They shift into the border between the real world and the fey realm in order to conceal themselves and lash out in a moment's notice at their prey. What's worse they also sport huge sabre like teeth and many spikes over their body making it very hard to escape them once they locked in on you. Your best bet in that case would be to run into the exact opposite direction of the drake as it may lose interest in pursuit. The shifting consumes huge amounts of energy and the drake may not be willing to expend more energy in chasing you down. If you have to fight however it is best to attack them from the rear or the side if possible. That way you at least avoid the very dangerous teeth and only have to deal with the spikes.
