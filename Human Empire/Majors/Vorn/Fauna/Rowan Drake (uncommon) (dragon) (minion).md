Rowan Drakes are a type of reptile native to [[Vorn]]. They are deeply loyal creatures once tamed and will protect their companions with their life if push comes to shove. In the wild Rowan Drakes hunt with the poisonous stinger attached to their tail, Preferring it over their fire breath as it often scorches prey beyond consumption. Furthermore they are technically capable of flight but it takes them great effort and training to fully master this ability and is therefore seldom seen in them regardless of tamed or wild rowan drakes. Lastly they also seem to understand very simple commands in [[Draconic]] and [[Vornese]] but will not be able to respond in kind or grasp any more complex issues. However even the understanding of such simple phrases requires a lot of training an practice or the presence of a [[Rose-Blessed]] who seem to have a more talented hand in taming these creatures. But even in the latter case it will not be able to replace true training and practice.

The rowan drake presses the contents of its stinger outwards in a 15ft radius of poison, dealing 1d4 persistent poison damage for every 2 levels the drake has to all creatures in the area (basic fortitude save). This uses a trained DC using the drake's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the drake is specialised.
