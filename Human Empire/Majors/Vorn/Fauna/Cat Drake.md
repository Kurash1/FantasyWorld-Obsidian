Perhaps the most adorable drake one could imagine. Completely equipped with everything your standard humanoid would find adorable. Big curly eyes, wobble, fluffy fur and paw like claws. Originally native to [[Vorn]], cat drakes can nowadays be found all over especially in [[human]] and [[Elf|elven]] lands. Their behaviour seems to resemble that of an ordinary cat and they also look like one , but they are a proper drake because , although they got feline ears too, they have a cute little draconic tail and small wyrm wings. They make great familiars  because they are utterly adorable and because they like to snuggle up tightly on a humanoid's laps. However they are also perfectly capable of understanding and executing orders. Given all this one will be hard pressed to not stumble over at least one cat drake in their travels through the Kingdom of [[Vorn]].
