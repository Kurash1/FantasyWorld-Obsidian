Perhaps the most adorable drake one could imagine. Completely equipped with everything your standard humanoid would find adorable. Big curly eyes, wobble, fluffy fur and paw like claws. Originally native to [[Vorn]], cat drakes can nowadays be found all over especially in [[human]] and [[Elf|elven]] lands. Their behaviour similar seems to resemble that of an ordinary cat. And that is also exactly how they look like a cat but as a drake. They even got the cat like ears but instead of a cat like tail they got a cute little draconic tail and small draconic wings. They make great familiars  because they are utterly adorable and because they like to snuggle up tightly on a humanoid's laps. However they are also perfectly capable of understanding and executing orders. Given all this one will be hard pressed to not stumble over at least one cat drake in their travels through the Kingdom of [[Vorn]].
