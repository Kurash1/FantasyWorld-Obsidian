**[[Vorn#History]]** 
Originally the Vornese were one of many valley tribes but when demonic incursions began and got close to their settled area they left the valley south in an event that is nowadays known as the [[March of Thorns and Tears]]. If not for the intervention of 4 dragons, nowadays known to the [[Vornese]] as the [[Rose Dragons]], they would never have made it all. Eventually after having lost many of their tribe on the steep and cold way of the mountain passes they arrived in some remote location inside the [[Gnomium]] were they settled on a great solitary mountain. There they attempted to wait out the catastrophe but the [[Gnomium]]'s eventual collapse caused them to act more proactive. Their diplomats gathered what was left of the gnomish armies and a stranded dwarven expeditionary force and fortified their country. It is from this time that the mighty [[Castle Rosen]] and the infamous [[Thornkeep]] stem. But this was not enough the dragons in their wisdom also created what is nowadays known as a [[Rose-Blessed]], a mighty sorcerous bloodline capable of fighting demon and orc alike with mighty spell fire. It is this how the [[Vornari]] held out in their newly formed Grand Duchy. The situation was terrible but stable with more and more invasions attempting to crash into the [[Vornari]] holdings. One by one they got repelled. But it proved increasingly difficult with one particular invasion even being able to cross the river [[Rosen]]. Only then hope seemed to arrive with a mighty human host of endless spears being spotted on the horizon who drove the invaders of.

It was then that their leader named [[Alexander]] arrived in their capital of Roseria and made the reluctant offer to make them a powerful realm in his new empire. For he was quite confused how such a people so utterly inept at war even survived so long. Regardless Vorn would be part of this new empire and be the bureaucratic and diplomatic centre of it. After the disappearance of the new emperor, it was thus Vorn that introduced the [[Prima Bulla Imperiala]] which established the electoral positions and the hereditary offices. Vorn chose for itself the boring but important office of Arch-steward making them capable of steering imperial legislation. This agreement held for centuries until the collapse of the far away Grand Duchy of [[Viola]] caused a cascading effect of crises to the empire which ultimately culminated in the event known as the [[Guilder War]]. During which Vorn was attacked unprovoked by the imperial ruler. The war lasted for 3 years in an almost stalemated position with many of the electors and a lot of smaller realms siding with Vorn. Eventually however the Vornese defences collapsed. At Veshen it came to a deciding battle between the imperial forces of the Arch Duchy of [[Veshni]] on one side and Vorn as well as its allied forces on the other. In this event the last grand duke of Vorn, [[Henry Thorne]] fell in battle. The remainders of his army retreating swiftly to Roseria expecting the worst. But soon after the battle the imperial army stopped. Apparently the imperial regent had died as well. The young heir of the Archduchy of [[Veshni]] ordered a full stop of his inherited forces. For he realised he lacked the votes to be crowned imperial regent. With 3 out of 7 electors siding with Vorn and the [[Disciple]] already thinking this whole war was a fruitless endeavour his chances to be elected were slim. So he reluctantly had to sign the [[Treaty of Roseria]] which elevated Vorn into a Kingdom, made him the first king of Vorn, established an elective monarchy and preserved the status quo ante bellum. In hindsight the war was a pointless endeavour which only further deteriorated imperial cohesion and led to Vorn being out for vengeance. Shortly after the war Vorn passed the [[Guilder League Prohibition Act]], which banned any association or activity of the [[Guilder League]] inside Vorn.
