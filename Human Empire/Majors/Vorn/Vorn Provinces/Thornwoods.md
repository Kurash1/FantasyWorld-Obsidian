An oddly shaped province in southern [[Vorn]].  Much of the crownland is situated here hence the name. As the Thornwoods are named after the Thorne dynasty. Long being royal hunting ground it is also here that the former summer residence of the Thorne Dynasty is situated, Hawthorn Palace. Furthermore one can also find the ancient magic academy of Rowan Tower here and the [[human]] and [[Elf|elven]] settlement of Elfgarden, that was established in the 2400s as a first test for settling new people into the watarian forest. 

[[# Elfgarden]]: 
Famous for its wine, it represents the sole region in [[Vorn]] able to produce this highly sought after commodity, that otherwise only comes over the Wineroad from the west. It is also one of the few places in the human world where you can find both [[Human|humans]] and [[Elf|elves]] in greater numbers settling in a singular settlement. This results in a surprising number of [[Menniskaelf|menniskaelves]] residing there as well. However much of the population of the place is poverty stricken as they are bound to the land via servitude. In 2542 a [[Rose-Blessed]] was born here to a family of poor wine maker peasants and was taken to Rowan Tower in 2548.
