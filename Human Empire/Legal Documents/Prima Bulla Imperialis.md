The Prima Bulla Imperialis (First Imperial Bull)
In recognition of the disappearance of our beloved and sacred emperor the imperial diet has decided on the initiative of the Grand Duchy of Vorn to introduce the following motion. The imperial throne should in absence of any advice for hereditary inheritance be elected. For undertaking such glorious cause as electors have been chosen the following realms:
1. The Grand Duchy of Astviel, who shall also hold the title of Arch-marshal, to ensure the need of the defensive and military of the empire. 
2. The Grand Duchy of Vorn, who shall also hold the title of Arch-steward, to ensure the need of a proper bureaucracy of the empire. 
3. The Grand Duchy of Watar, who shall also hold the title of Arch-cup-bearer, to ensure the need of the less populous countries in the Empire.
4. The Grand Duchy of Viola, who shall also hold the title Arch-chamberlain, to ensure the need of the economics of the empire.
5. The Magocracy of the Towers, who shall also hold the title of Arch-magos, to ensure the need of the magical in the empire. 
6. and 7. Two theocratic realms as decided by his Holiness. Each of which will hold the arch-chancellorship over one half of the empire in deputation of the emperor. 

Furthermore the imperial diet has decided to bar the following realms from an electoral position perpetually. 
1. The Arch duchy of Veshni who shall be elected first non hereditary emperor.
2. The realm of his Holiness who shall crown the emperors.

In Addition to this provision the Imperial Diet agreed to the following articles to ensure a continuation of order. 
1. All imperial legislation shall stem out of the imperial diet. The exact provisions here are that decisions require at least a simple majority of Princes in the Diet and the agreement of all electors.
2. The Regent shall sign any law the diet passed safe those they deem worthy to veto. 
3. A Veto can be overridden by a 3/5 majority of the imperial diet or by unanimous agreement by all electors.
4. The Arch-steward is declared to be the civil right hand of the Regent.
5. The Arch-marshal is declared to be the military right hand of the Regent.
6. The Arch-chancellors aid the Regent in governing the respective halves of the Empire.
7. In Case of Incapacity of the Regent the Arch-steward and Arch-marshal function in their respective roles as deputies of the Regent. 
8. The organisation of magic shall be no topic for the Empire and shall be handled fully by the Arch-magos as they see fit. 
9. Only Grand duchies and Archbishoprics can be electors. 
10. In case a vacancy in the electorate occurs the Regent counsels with the remaining electors to find a suitable replacement to be elevated to the status of Grand duchy. In case of the theocratic electors no such vacancy should in theory arise as they are non hereditary territory. But in case such a vacancy occurs his Holiness chooses suitable replacements. In case no electors shall remain the Regent shall consult with the diet instead. 
11. The diet is only qualified to hold a vote if at least 5 of the 7 electors are present and if at least 3/5 of its members are present. Presence of the regent is not required. In the case of absence of the regent the Arch-steward will head the matters of civility and the Arch-marshall shall head the matters of military action. Neither of which shall have the authority to sign any legislation unless specifically granted by the Regent themselves. 
12. Electors are electable. 
13. Electors are guaranteed perpetuity in territory and office.
14. The realm of his Holiness and the Regent's realm are likewise guaranteed perpetuity in territory and office.
15. Imperial members may not hold territories of other members. 
16. Imperial Cities and Imperial Abbeys are under protection of the Regent.
